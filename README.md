# MayaRiggingTool
A simple rigging tool I made in Maya. It can:
 - add suffixes and prefixes to Joints and selection hierarchies
 - create circle, square or cube nurbs curve controllers for all or selected joints
 - make nulls for each controller and parent-constrain them
The goal of this tool is just to make the rigging happen quicker.

To use it in Maya, open up the Script Editor window, click on a new tab and choose Python as the source language. Copy paste the code from the file into that window, find Ui() at the bottom and highlight it. While highlighted hit ctrl+enter and the rigging window should open!

P.S. I might support this if enough people want to use it, but right now it's pretty much just an assignment I finished for Uni. Enjoy!
