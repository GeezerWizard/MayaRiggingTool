# MayaRiggingTool
A simple rigging tool I made in Maya. It can:
 - add suffixes and prefixes to Joints and selection hierarchies
 - create circle, square or cube nurbs curve controllers for all or selected joints
 - make nulls for each controller and parent-constrain them
The goal of this tool is just to make the rigging happen quicker.

To use it, just open up
